vi INTRODUCTION.

whether he is a member of the Church at all.l If any Christian
could be head of the Church, at the same time with Christ, the Church
would be a monster, having two headS. Hence the Apostles with one
accord declared themselves to be only servants of this Head, and of
the Church: and never did any one of them presume to assert that
he himself was the head or the bridegroom of the Church,2 No
Christian can determine the Pope to be the head, or even a member,
of the Church, either by election or by any statute, for membership
depends upon the predestination and grace of God.3

It is no article of the saith that one must obey the Pope in
order to be saved3 for there were holy men in days before the Papacy
was known. In the days of the Apostles, and even at the present time,
there have been, and are, individuals and whole nations· wh’o never
heard of the existence of the Pope. Moreover there are periods during
which the papal chair is unoccupied.

The Pope is not the head of the universal, but only of the
particular (militant) Church; and this too only if he lives in accordance
with the commands of Christ4. In that case we owe him obedience,
but so far only as he enforces the commands of Christ. Further
than this, nothing can tend to the spiritual good of the Christian
but a sound faith.⁵

Upon every command of the Pope, we must enquire whether that
which he orders is in harmony with the Bible; and this is one
reason why every Christian ought to be acquainted with the Holy
ScriptureS. 6

It need not be objected, that in this case no Christian would
believe that his Priest‚ Vicar or Bishop was predestinate, and therefore

¹ Nullus papa debet presumere se esse caput ecclesie . . . non sic assereret
quod sit predestinatus, eo quod non est de substancia fidei quod iste sit pre-
destinatus . . . ² Ideo apostoli confessi sunt concorditer se esse servos istius
capiti53 nunquam autem presumpsit aliquis apostolorum asserere se esse caput. ³ Non
est in potestate alicuius christiani, constitucione, eleccione vel acceptacione statuere
quod dominus papa sit caput vel membrum ecclesie, nam hoc consistit in predesti—
nacione et gracia Dei nostri. 4 Dominus papa non est caput universalis sed
particularis ecclesie, dum tamen perseveranter vixerit tamquam papa, si non est
predestinatus, non est capitaneus in ecclesia sancta Dei. 5 Omnibus sufficit ad
salutem fides formata quod sit una universitas fidelium predestinatorum. 6 Et'
hec est racio quare oportet omnem catholicum cognoscere scripturam sacram.
