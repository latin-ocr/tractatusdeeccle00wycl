the fly-Ieaves at the beginning and end of the volume. As this
foundation was due to the benevolence of Simon of Tissnow, one
of the most zealous of the Bohemian Wycliffites7 we may gather that
the Codex was at one time in his possession. At least he is known
not only to have been thoroughly familiar with Wyclif’s work on the
Church, but to have imitated it himself.

All the tracts in A are written by the same hand. In this hand
also are the numerous Czechian glosses, of which the principal appears
in the facsimile forming ’[ᾕέ frontispiece to this volume. The indices
at the end of each of the tracts are in a later hand. The corrections
(in red or black ink) are very carefully entered. The handwriting is
a very neat one: and the division of the work into Chapters, and of
chapters into paragraphs &o is clearly marked. Large letters on the left
margin indicate the beginning of the paragraphs: whilst a further
subdivision is made by small letters or figures, placed on the right
or left hand according to the space at command.

The contents of the paragraphs are noted either on the upper
or lower margins. Resides this notice of contents‚ the margins contain
various disjointed comments on the text — expressions of agreement,
applause‚ derision etc. -— names of authors referred to in the text,
and so on.

b. The Cod. pal. Vindob. 3929 (A1).

As this manuscrIpt has been already described by Buddensieg‚ it
will only be necessary here to refer to his account of it.¹ The tract·
“De ecclesia” is on fol. 13—114³‚ and is written by the same hand
as the other works contained in this Codex. The copyist was a ssohemian,
and no friend to the Germans, as appears from a marginal note (fol.
174b): “Olus est herba melancolica que signat mundo deditus et ideo
Theotunici pre aliis gentibus comedunt olus, quia plus sunt mundo
et avaricie dediti”. That this copy was not finished until after the
24⁸1 of May 1415, is evident from the following gloss: “Et Johannes

papa XXIII„ qui pro heretico et diabolo incarnato est condempnatus
in Constancia''.
