of the lay world: the second part discusses the relation of the spiritual
to the secular power, ,and contains therefore Wyclif's views on politics
and Church government: the third part treats chiefly of certain liturgical
questions, such as the cultus of the saints and of the departed &ot
the fourth part deals with the question of absolution.

a. The conception of the Church.

The first part contains six chapters (l-vx). The Church—so runs
Wyclif's explanation—is the sum total of all those who from eternity
are destined to salvation (predestinate).

The Church consists of three parts, the triumphant, the sleeping,
and the militant. The triumphant are the blessed in heaven, the
sleeping are the souls in purgatory‚ and the militant are the Christians

Ἴ engaged in conflict with the world.

No one who is rejected from eternity (praescitus) has part in this
Church.2 It is not the same thing “being of the Church” and “being
in the Church''. Not every one who is in the Church is also of the
Church, but on the contrary: for as there is much in the. human
body, waste and such like, which is no part of the body, so there
may also be reprobates in the Church, who will one day have to be
removed from the body of the Church.

No place and no human choice can cause any one to become
a member of the holy Catholic Church, but the divine predesti-
nation alone.

There are. not many Churches, but only one universal (Catholic)
Church, outside of which there is no salvation.3 The head of this
Church is, Jesus Christ.

No Pope should affirm that he is the head of the Church, for
he does not even know whether hc is predestinate‚ and therefore

¹ Quamvis ecclesia dicatur multipliciter in scriptura, suppono quod sumatur
pro congregacione omnium predestinatorum . . . ² Ista ecelesia... non habet
aliquem prescitum partem sui ecclesia non habebit prescitos sed solum predesti
natos partes suas . . . Impossibile est prescitum esse membrum . . . ecclesie . . .
3 Tantum una est et non plures ecclesie catholice... Extra ecclesiam catholicam
non est salus vel remissio peccatorum.
