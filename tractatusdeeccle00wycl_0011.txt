prelatCS, no faith placed in the canonization of the saints, and that
the entire system of religion would be shaken.

As to the first objection, every Christian may be at rest in the
belief, that no less than Christ Himself is his Priest, Vicar, Bishop
or Pope.1 The believes should regard those prelates only whose good
works he sees, as Christ's representatives.2 With respect to the question
of the canonization of the saints, it is very possible that some may be
honoured here as saints, who are rejected by God.3 Of the sanctity
of some, for instance the Apostles or the martyrs of the early Church,
we can be certain: but not so of the modern saints, who are canonized
for motives of family or of pecuniary interest.4 Neither can it be
urged, that the sanctity of these persons is attested by miracles, for
such miracles as those of which one hears in these days, have no
power to give a true saith. Also it may very well be that diabolical
delusions are at work in these cases.5

The cultus of saints, as carried on at the present day, is the
source of many errorS,6 and many a saint might pray for us much

“We know not whether our spiritual ruler is predestinate or
reprobate'', all wranglings and extortions would cease in the Church,
since those men who strive after worldly goods would not be looked
upon as members of the Church, and the excommunications they
