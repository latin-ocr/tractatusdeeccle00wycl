The notes on the contents, consisting chiefly of references to
authorities, may be looked upon as sufficient.

ln conclusion, Iwould offer my hearty thanks to the friends
who have taken a warm interest in this publication, and helped it
forward to the utmost of their power. My thanks are due in the first
place to ΜΓ. F. D. Matthew, who has not only placed a copy of D
at the disposal of the editor, and undertaken the writing and correction
of the English side-notes, but has also assisted this work in many other
ways, and to F. J. Furnivall Esqu., the energetic and considerable
president of our Wyclif Society, who with unvarying courtesy assisted
rne in the edition and printing of this book. The translation of this
Introduction into English has been very willingly undertaken by Miss
Alice Shirley, daughter of the departed master in Wyclif research.
For various suggestions Ι am indebted to Dr. Buddensieg of Dresden;
and for furthering this work by the sending and procurIng the sending
of manuscripts, to Hofrath Dr. Ernst von Birk, head librarian of the
Imperial Library of Vienna, to the librarian of the University Library
