received this, the Pope himself has no right to grant absolution. The
clergy should instruct the people in this belief, and uproot any abuses
which may arise from the granting of indulgences. To every sin,
of which a good man may be guilty, a punishment is assigned, which
none but God can remit.

2. The transmission in manuscript.
a. The Cod. pal. Vindobonensis 1294 (A).

With the exception of a fragment, of which more will be said
hereafter‚ no copy of Wyclif's treatise on the Church has been
preserved in England. On the other hand, a Codex exists on the Con-
tinent, which was undoubtedly transcribed at Oxford, at the Whit-
suntide of 1407, by a Bohemian student, and revised with the help of
another Bohemian student. This is the Cod. 1294 of the Imperial
Library of Vienna.

This Codex contains on 251 parchment leaves, large octavo
(24¹s20m >< 16¹s20m): Ι. fol. 1³³¹—-127a Wyclif's tract “De veritate sacrae
scripturae”; ΙΙ. fol. 12821—210b the tract “De sancta matre ecclesia'’,
and ΙΙΙ. fol. 21221--251b the tract “De dominio divino''. The two latter
are likewise by Wyclif.

Each of the 251 leaves of the Codex contains 4 columns
(a, b, c, d): and each column contains about 40 lines. The paging
does not include two blank leaves at the beginning, and one at *the end.

Both the copyist and the corrector of this MS. vvere Bohemians,
as is evident from several Czechian glosseS. A note at the end of the
tract “De veritate sacrae scripturae'' (fol. 119d) gives both their names:
“Correctus graviter anno domini 1407 in vigilia Purificacionis sancte
Marie Oxon(ii) per Nicolaum Faulfiss et Georgium de Knyehnic2.’'

The tradition of later ages has assigned to Nicolaus Faulfisch the
distinction of having been the first to introduce the theological
writings of Wyclif into Bohemia. The impossibility of this will
however be seen, when we remember that Wycliffite doctrines had
been formally condemned at Prague, four years earlier than 1407.

During his residence in England, Nicolaus Faulfisch became
'thoroughly acquainted with English Church affairs. lt was from his
recollections that Hus obtained an amusing anecdote, with which he
