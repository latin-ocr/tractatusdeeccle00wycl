xviii INTRODUCTION.

used to entertain the auditory of his sermons.¹ The enthusiastic
admiration of Nicolaus Faulfisch for Wyclif appears in his having
brought to Prague not only a certificate (stated to have been forged
by Faulfisch himself) giving the attestation of the University of Oxford
to Wyclif's orthodoxy— but also a piece of Wyclif’s gravestone⁷ which
was venerated by the Bohemian Wycliffites as a precious relic.2

It is very curious‚ that Hus, when questioned at the Council, could
not remember who the companion of Faulfisch had been. On being
asked who had brought this “forged'’ document to Prague, he answered,
“Nicolaus Faulfisch, with another, whose name I do not know”. And
yet George of Knyehnicz was studying at Prague, and took academical
degrees there, at the time that Hus was Rector of the University.3

The three tracts contained in Cod. A. were not originally bound
together into one volume. This may be seen, not so much from the
separate paging of each tract, as from the circumstance that they have
not been bound in the same order in which they were written. The
first in date was the “De veritate sacrae scripturae’': then came the “De
dominio divino’'‚ and lastly “De ecclesia”: in the present volume how-
ever “De ecclesia” is placed in the middle.

It is evident also that the three tracts were not bound together
before they reached ssohemia; for a parchment document, relating to
the founding of a Church in the Moravian town of Meseritz,4 forms

original Czech) pag. 729: Audivi a fideli viro bonae memoriae Nicolao qui vocabatur
Faulfisch se, cum in Anglia versaretur, cognosse coquum quendam apud quem
cibum caperet. Quem cum episcopus interrogasset cur litteras sacras contra mandatum
lingua Anglica legeret defendit se argumento ex litteris sacris hausto. Cui episcopus2
“Sciis tu, quicum loquaris?’' Ille vero respondit: “Cum episcopo homine.'’ Tum
episcopus: “Tu vero miselle laice, mecum colloqui audes literis sacris nitens?'' Ille
respondit: “Equidem scio te Christo non esse maiorem speroque me non esse
peiorem diabolo. Iam vero, quia clementissimus dominus Christus placide literas
sacras a diabolo audivit, quidni igitur tu audias qui minor sis Christo a me homine?”
Episcopus autem iratus colloqui cum eo nolebat. Itaque coquus literis sacris episcopum
superavit sicut Christus diabolum. 2 Ille Faulfiss portavit unam petiam lapidis
de sepulcro ipsius Wielef, quem postea Pragae pro reliquiis venerabantur et habebant.
