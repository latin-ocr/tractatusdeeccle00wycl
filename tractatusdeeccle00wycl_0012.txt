viii INTRODUCTION.

might pronounce would not be regarded as effectual.1 By their insatiable
desire for posts of honour, vain pleasures and the good things of
this world, the reprobate would be recognised.

Wyclif dwells upon this point with evident satisfaction. He depicts
in strong colours the contempt of the clergy of his time for thle
poverty which Christ and the Apostles esteemed so highly: and how
they find more to regret in the loss of worldly goods than in the
loss of virtue.

It is only after treating this and kindred matters-that Wyclif
returns to his subject: the division of mankind into the elect
(praedestinati) and the reprobate (praesciti). The latter are shut out
from the Church, even though they may be holding ecclesiastical
dignities; and a man⁷s salvation being thus entirely due to the grace
of God in his predestination, it cannot depend upon his connexion
with the official Church, or the mediation of the priesthood. Thus,
as Lechler justly observes, the recognition of the believer’s free and
immediate access to the mercy of God in Christ, in other words, the

universal priesthood of the faithful, is involved in Wyclif's conception
of the Church.2

b. Wyclif’s views on Chureh politicS.

At the seventh chapter Wyclif breaks off his theological disquisitions
on the nature of the Church, and an episode is introduced, which
originally had no connexion with the other portions of the book,
(indeed it still exists in MS. as an independent tractate — “De
captivo Hispanensi⁷’3) and its present place was only assigned to it by
Wyclif on the last redaction of his works. The formal introduction at
once marks the severance of this portion of the text from that Which
precedes, After the opening words it becomes clear that we have
here a judgment of Wyclif, laid by him before Parliament at the
command of the King.
