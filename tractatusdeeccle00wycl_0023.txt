ΙΝΊ RODUCTION. xxi

The copyist of A„ has not reproduced all the marginal notes that
are found in A. The marginal notes in A„ in red and black ink, are
by two different hands. One of these two scribes was not very partial
to Wyclif's theology, and in several places he animadverts on his
doctrine, or modifies his statements¹

c. The Codex universitatis pragensis X. D. 11. (Β).

In spite of the care with which Nicolaus Faulfisch and his com-
panion addressed themselves to their task, A contains a number of
errors, and many passages as they stand in A will yield no sense.
Al being then only a copy of A, the prospect of the restoration of a
correct text of “De ecclesia” would have been very poor, had Ι not
lately been so fortunate as to find a Codex1 in which the treatise
is in a far better condition in these very passages. This manuscript,
which came into my hands almost by chance in the year 1883,
is the Codex X. D. 11. of the University library of Prague.

This Codex, to which we will refer as B, a large folio volume
(31cm >< 22cm) consists of 214 paper leaves, of which the last is left
blank. lt contains first the tract “De ecclesia⁷' (fol. 13—1303) and
Wyclif’s “De officio regis'' (1302—2iob). There is besides in the
appendix an extract from the treatise “De officio regis’' (fol. 210b — 212³)
and extracts from the first twelve chapters of “De ecclesia'’ (fol.
2122—214b). The external arrangement of A is very much the same
as that of Β. Here too every leaf has four columns of forty—three lines.

The Codex was at one time in the possession of Magister Peter
of Zepekow2‚ a friend and follower of Hus. Peter of Zepekow was
a man of considerable mark at the University of Prague, where he
was professor up to the time of his death, which took place in 1431.

¹In Shirley's catalogue it is wanting. 21nside the upper cover is
following entry: “A magistro Petro de Zepekow exemi tria volumina (tercium adhuc
habet) in 30 g(r0ssis)''. Peter of Zepekow studied at Prague. He took his bachelor's
degree in 1408, his master's in 1412. (He had not therefore sold the book before
this year.) He was Dean for the first time in 1418, and held that office again in
1423, 1430 and 1431. Vide Mon. un. Prag, I, 21, 397, 418, 418, 420-22, 424, 426,
