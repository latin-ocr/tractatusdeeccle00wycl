XXX lN'l'RODUCTION.

shall not be surprised to find that Simon of Tissnow was thoroughly
acquainted with that work.

After the condemnation of Hus, Simon, at that time Vicar of
Tobitschau in Moravia, became involved in a dispute With a monk
of the Carthusian Convent of St. Josaphat at Olm't'itz‚ who impugned
the orthodoxy of his doctrine. From the documents relating to this
controversy, which have come down to us, we learn that Simon of
Tissnow had not only entirely adopted Wyclif’s theory of the Church‚
but had propagated it by public discourseS.1 Simon⁷s opponent, Paul
of Prague, endeavours in two treatises to confute this Wycliffite
doctrine. ln the second of these it is clear, even from the opening
words “Utrum ecclesia sancta sit numerus predestinatorum’'‚ that Wyclif
is the object of attacl<.2 This treatise contains the following significant
passage on the relation of the Hussites to Wyclifz— “Si auten] dicant
quod a Deo venerint et ab apostolis atque evangelio -— sed econtra:
Non multum temporis est quod esse ceperunt, quoniam sicut patet a
Jobanne Wycleff exordium acceperunt, qui hanc viam Hussitarum incepit.

One of Simon of Tissnow’s disciples was'John Laurin, who in
the year 1417 defended publicly at Prague W‘yclif's doctrine of the
Church: in consequence of which he two years later received a legal
summons from Paul of Prague, to answer to the charge of holding
heretical opinions. A regular lawsuit ensued between John Laurin,
who meanwhile had become Canon of Olm'utz‚ and Paul of Prague.
John Laurin was compelled greatly to modify his statementS.

Many other of the Hussites expressed themselves to the same
effect as John Laurin on the subject of the Chumh, and quite in the
sense of Wyclif’s theory: but it is not my intention here to examine
either their declarations⁷ or those of an opposite character such as
were made by Andreas of Brod⁷ Stephan of Dolein, and otherS.

¹ “Tractatus contra Hussitas presertim contra magistrum Simonem de Tyssnow,
plebanum Towaczoviensem autore magistro plebano de Dolan diocesis Olmucensis
olim s. theologie Prage doctoris'’‚ so runs the title to this tract, which is contained
in Cod. 303 of the State Archives at Brt'mn, 2 This will also be seen from
the following passage in the first tract: “Sed quia secta Hussitarum‚ que dicit quod
ecclesia sancta catholica sit numerus omnium predestinatorum, peccat mortalissime
contra hunc articulum fidei . . . igitur in tractatu presenti probabitur . . . quod talis
proposicio sit salsa, heretica, impossibilis, caput et origo tocius heresis Hussitarum . . .
