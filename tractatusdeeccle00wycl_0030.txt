xxviii INTRODUCTloN.

bear the same title “De ecclesia''; but their connexion with Wyclif’s
book is only an indirect one, their immediate reference being to the
work of Hus. The most considerable of Hus’s opponents was un-
doubtedly Stanislaus of Znaim. After his banishment from Prague in
the year 1413, he retired into-Moravia‚ where, until his death in
1414, he employed his fertile pen against the Bohemian and Mora-
vian followers of Wyclif. At this time the two tracts were composed,
which he, after the example of Wyclif and Hus, entitled “De eccle-
sia” 1; — writings which will however bear no comparison, as to matter
and form, with Wyclif's work, or even with that of Hus. The one
tract contains a collection of definitions of the Church: the other,
which is rather more detailed‚ treats of the papal power of the keys.
Both these* works seem moreover to have been only preparatory to
a larger treatise “De ecclesia''‚ which he did not live to write. He
died suddenly just as he was about to set off on his journey to
Constance, to attend the Council.

It is impossible to speak of Stanislaus of Znaim‚ without at the
same time calling to mind Stephan of Palecz, since the two were
united, as at first in their affection for Hus, so latterly in their hatred
towards him. Like stanislaus, Stephan <who was one of the principal
accusers of Hus at Constance), denounced Wyclif both in speech and
writing2 Wyclif’s conception of the Church was an especial object of
attack‚ and it is against this doctrine that the so-called “Replicatio
Quidamistarum’'2 and the two tracts “De ecclesia⁷' are directed.

c. John Hofmann of Schweidnitz.

Amongst the earliest opponents of Wyclifism in Bohemia was John
Hofmann of Schweidnitz (in silesia), who for many years held an
influential position amongst the German Professors at the University
of Prague. When, in consequence of the revolution which took place
in that University, in the year 1409, the Professors left Prague, and
formed a new sphere of labour at Leipzig, Hofmann was of their

In the Cod. Treboniensi (Wittingau) A 16, the title runs: “Stanislaus de Znoyma
contra Hus, De ecclesia”. ² As Hus bestowed upon Palecz the name os “liar'’
(fictor), so the latter called the adherents of Hus “Quidamistae'⁷.
