INTRODUCTION. XXV

that the tract consists of several parts, which were originally written
with different objects, and had no connexion with one another, we
shall not be surprised to find that a chapter here and there was com-
posed earlier than that which precedes it. Chapter xx, for example,
may well have been written long before the rest of the book, and,
like the ¹7th chapter, it still exists in manuscript (with slight alterations)
as a separate work.¹ The last chapter was apparently written whilst
Gregory XI was still living.2 The 7th chapter, on the other hand, can
certainly not be earlier than September or October 1378, for it contains
the statement of opinion delivered by Wyclif before the parliament
which assembled at Gloucester on the 28⁸¹ of October 1378. The
2nd chapter was written at the time when the intelligence of the election
of Urban VI. was spreading throughout England; therefore doubtless
about Easter 1378. Wyclif here praises God, for having in these days
given to His Church so excellent a head, as was Urban VL3 There
is not in this place the slightest hint of an Antipope: on the other
hand it is clear from a passage in chapter X111, that at the time when
this chapter was written, the schism had already broken out.4 Whilst
in the first passage Wyclif speaks of Urban in terms of the highest
praise, later references to him are less favourable, and in the last
mentioned passage the title of “pseudo—monk'' is bestowed upon him,
as well as upon his rival. The separate portions of this tract were
therefore probably put together during the autumn and winter of 1378.
There is nothing in the work itself to warrant in any degree the
assigning of a later date than this.

1 Shirley, Catalogue, p. 16 (Mulierem fortem quis inveniet?) and p. 23 (De
captivo Hispaniensi). ‘² Quid quero valet fingere quod iste Gregorius XI ordinavit
ut immolacio Isaac . . . valeret ad ordinacionem suam cognato suo iam mormO.
3 Sed benedictus dominus matris nostre qui nostre peregrinanti invencule diebus
istis providit caput catholicum, virum evangelicum Urbanum VI, qui rectificando
instantem ecclesiam, ut vivat conformiter legi Christi, ordinatur ordinate a se ipso et
suis domesticis. 4 Unde illud magnum scisma factum per Sergium monachum
sicut et illud scisma quod hodie pullulat per duos pseudomonachos . . . . So too
the passage: ut oculata fide patet diebus nostris cum due partes cardinalium imponun
pape nostro et fratribus eum foventibus hereticam pravitatem.
