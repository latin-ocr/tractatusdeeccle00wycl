1NTRo DUCTION. ix

Whilst replying upon the occasion of a recent case1 to the question,
whether it is allowable for the King's government to drag from their
shelter escaped prisoners who have taken refuge in Westminster
Abbey—he unfolds his views upon the mutual relations of the Church
and State.

The case under discussion was the bloody deed which took place
on the 11th of August 1378, and of which Walsingham gives a
detailed, but at the same time very onesided, account.2 During the
campaign of 1367, two of the King's vassals had taken prisoner the
Castilian Count of Denia, and had received from the English generals a
written promise that the ransom for the prisoner should be paid to
themselves. In place of the Count, this eldest son went to England and
remained there a prisoner for ten years. After the death of the Black
Prince and of the old King, the advisers of <his young successor
demanded that the two knights should deliver up the Spaniard. It was
hoped that a number of English knights, then prisoners in Spain, would
be liberated in exchange. The government negociated for a long time with
the two knights: but the negociations proving ineffectual, recourse
was had to stronger measures;—the knights were seized and imprisoned
in the Tower.3 From thence they made their escape by force,4 and

quuntur. ² Wyclifs version of the affair is, as may be seen from other contemporary
sources, much more correct. Amore exact account is given in the “Continuatio
Eulogii Historiarum'’ (tom. III, p. 342): Eodem anno Hispani miserunt ad regem
Anglie pro liberacione comitis de Dene, quem Iohannes Hawle et Ricardus Shakyll
ceperunt antea in bello Hispanie; sed ipsi timentes perdere redempcionem sui
prisonarii noluerunt ipsum producere ad domini regis mandatum. Rex per concilium
suurn obiecit eis quod ipsi fecerunt carcerem in domibus suis infra regnum contra
suum mandatum . . . Ipsi vero prostrato eorum custode fugerunt ad Westrnonasterium
(Wyclif's account tallies exactly with this: Prostrato custode carceris intrarunt . . .).

was also misinformed as to the motives which induced the government to restore
the imprisoned Count of Denia to liberty: see my Essay, “Neuere Erscheinungen
der Wiclif-Literatur”, in the “Historische Zeitschrift⁷’ vol. 53, p. 40. ⁴¹Prostrato
