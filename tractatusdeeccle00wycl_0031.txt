number, and took part in founding the prosperity of Leipzig. In the
year 1413 he became a Canon3 in 1427 Bishop of Meissen‚ which
office he held until his death in 1451. He bequeathed his valuable
library (which included the works of Bradwardine and of Thomas
Netter of Walden1) to St. Mary's College in Leipzig.

His principal work is a treatise against the Utraquists: “Tractatus
contra communicantes laicos'’.2 ln this he pronounces in the most
emphatic manner against the Church theory of Wyclif and Hus33
and must to this extent be reckoned amongst the assailants of Wyclif's
book on the Church, with which he was undoubtedly acquainted‚
and which he probably also possessed. Besides this he attacks other
of Wyclif's doctrines4 very much in the manner of Walden.

A faithful frIend of Hus, and like himself, as we have said, enthu-
siastically attached to Wyclif’s doctrines, was Simon of Tissnow, —

Prague Universsty, defended Wyclif’s tract “De probacionibus propo-
sicionum”‚ after a half humorous, half sarcastic fashion. The well-
known Codex 1294 of the Royal Library of Vienna (A), was in his
possession. As this Codex contains Wyclif's book on the Church, we
