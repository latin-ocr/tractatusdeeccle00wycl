Introduction.

1. Oriqin and contente of the book “On the Churoh”.

At the present date, at which only a comparatively small portion
of Wyclif's works have appeared in print, it may still ·be doubtful to
which of them the palm belongs, both in respect of form and contents3
but at least it may safely be said, that his book on the Church must
be reckoned amongst his ripest and most important utteranceS. For,
let us consider what a powerful impression the work by Hus
bearing the same title, produced upon his contemporaries; a work
which, as Pierre d’Ailly said,¹ “by its immense abundance of proofs‚
combats the authority and plenary power of the Pope, no less than
the Koran combats the Catholic faith’‘. And yet this celebrated
book is only a meagre abridgment of Wyclif's “De Ecclesia”. What
if ⁴the contemporaries of Hus, who as assembled at Constance
represented the intellectual capacity of the Europe of that day, had
known the original that he had drawn upon, instead of the' feeble
imitation!

In order rightly to understand the origin of the treatise on the
Church, we must go back to the years 1377 and 1378, during
which Wyclif found himself exposed to attack from the combined
forces of the hierarchy, or, as many at that time said, of the Church.
The hierarchy however is not the Church: and it is the distinction
between what the Church is in reality‚ and what the multitude under-
stand by it,2 which Wyclif sets himself to expound in this work.
