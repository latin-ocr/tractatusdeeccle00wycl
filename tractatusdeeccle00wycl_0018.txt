priests, but it contains also some earnest exhortations to abolish
superfluous ceremonies.

This last chapter, originally written perhaps whilst Gregory XI,
whom Wyclif frequently attacks with great fierceness,1 was still living,
is much more polemical in tone than those which precede. Wyclif desires,
by the promulgation of his doctrine, to enlighten the inferior clergy,
that they may be on their guard against the abuses which spring
from indulgences.2 It is true that the Popes themselves were the most
guilty in the matter3 but they and their Cardinals are after all not
infallible, and should only be believed when their teaching agrees
with that of the Bima—3

The doctrine, whichWyclif now proceeds to expound, amid frequent
references to Bonaventura and Thomas Aquinas, and keeping their
arguments fully in view throughout, is much better known than the
foregoing portions of the book on the Church, as the greater part of
it was adopted by Hus, in whose famous treatise “Against Papal
lndulgences” Wyclif is followed word for word.4 In particular, the eight
conclusions, in which Wyclif's reasonings result, are entirely accepted
by Hus. These conclusions are as follows:-—No one is capable of
receiving absolution, unless he is worthy in the sight of God: the
worthier the man, the more will absolution profit him. The absolution
of no Bishop or Pope will benefit the man who has not examined
himself before God. The Bishop’s absolution will only be of value,
if he instructs the faithful in the religion of Christ, urges them
to devotion and to the love of God, and so makes them capable of
the reception of divine grace. God alone can forgive sins: men can do
so only when they have received a special revelation3 without having
