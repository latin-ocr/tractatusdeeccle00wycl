ssoth the tracts in Β are written by the same hand, in clearly
defined, legible characters. Whether the copy was made in England
or Bohemia, must remain undecided. Only thus much is certain: —

1. That it is no more a copy of Α, than A is of Β.

2. That A and B proceed from one and the same source (X).-
A directly⁷ Β perhaps through an intermediate link.

The first point is evident for the following reasons: —

1. Wherever gaps occur in A, whether large or small, Β has the
complete text: therefore Β cannot be derived from A.

2. On the other hand, in certain cases where there are gaps in Β,
Α has the complete text.

That A and Β had a common origin, the following considerations
will show: —

1. Certain words are indistinctly written, both in A and in Β,
and therefore presumably were so in their original.

2. Certain marginal notes, such as figureS, letters and tables of
contents correspond in A and Β, in an arrangement which is often
singular, and (in the case of the tables of contents) in a wording
frequently strange.

The relation of the three Manuscripts to one another stands there-
fore thus: -

A MS. containing a part only of the treatise “De Ecclesia''‚
Cod. C. ι. 23 of the Trinity College library‚ Dubliu, does not belong
to this group of MSS. and calls for separate consideration.

d. The Codex Dublinensis C. 1. 23. (D).

This Codex contains only the 7th chapter, registered by Shirley

as an independcnt tract, as originally it certainly was (De captivo
Hispanensi).
